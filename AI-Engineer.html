Skills needed for an AI Engineer:

AI Engineer builds applications on top of pretrained application models. Basically a software engineer with AI concepts (think of it as added technology to the existing tech stack). 
1. Model Adaptation using Prompt Engineering and RAG and fine tuning.
2. Prioritize scalability, evaluation, inference optimization and deployment.
3. Security, Scalability, resilience, data handling and user feedback.
4. Foundation Skills - Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra
5. Matrix Operations and Probability Distributions
6. Python programming or Javascript(Typescript)
7. Basic Software Development Concepts - Git, API etc.
8. ML Concepts - Supervised/Unsupervised, Model Evaluations metrics, (overfit/underfit)
9. LLM APIs (OpenAPIs, Ollama)
10. Prompt Engineering
11. RAG Models (vector dbs and embeddings)
12. Experiment with other models (other finetuned models or different architectures) on HuggingFace.
13. AI architecture - (Input handling, context construction and output processing)
14. Play with building sample applications like Chatbots, Content Generators and Simple Classification Systems)
15. LLMOps, Langchain, use custom data Embeddings for Semantic Search and recommendations.
16. RAG - Chunking Strategies, Optimize Embedding Techniques, different retrieval methods
17. Foundation Models - Fine Tuning (LoRA, Model Selection decisions (cost, performance, licensing)
18. Robust Evaluation Systems - Test Model performance, Measure hallucinations and bias, Automated and Human Evaluation)
19. Inference Optimization - Quantization, Distillation and Optimized Deployment models
20. Agent Systems - MCP, A2A, manage context over extended interactions.
